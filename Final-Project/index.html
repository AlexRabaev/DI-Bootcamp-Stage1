            <strong>1879</strong> - Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14, into a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews, Hermann and Pauline Einstein. He was a shy and introverted child, who excelled in mathematics and science from an early age.

            <strong>1895</strong> - At the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich. He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. He was an average student but was known for his independent thinking and unconventional approach to problems.

            <strong>1900</strong> - Einstein graduated from the Polytechnic with a degree in mathematics and physics. He passed the exams successfully, but not brilliantly. Many professors highly appreciated the abilities of the student Einstein, but no one wanted to help him continue his scientific career. Einstein himself later recalled "I was bullied by my professors, who did not like me because of my independence and closed my path to science".

            <strong>1905</strong> - Entered the history of physics as the "Year of Miracles". This year, the Annals of Physics published three of Einstein's seminal papers that launched a new scientific revolution.
            <ul>
                <li>"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" which introduced the theory of special relativity and challenged the classical notion of space and time.</li>
                <li>"On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light" which proposed the idea of quantization of light and laid the foundation for the development of quantum mechanics.</li>
                <li>"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat" which provided the first theoretical explanation of Brownian motion and provided evidence for the existence of atoms.</li>
                <li>"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?" which proposed the equation E=mc², the most famous equation in physics, and established the equivalence of mass and energy.</li>
            </ul>
            These papers established Einstein's reputation as a leading theoretical physicist and were widely recognized as some of the most important scientific works of the 20th century.

He became a vocal advocate for civil rights and pacifism, and worked on the development of nuclear weapons during World War II.

            <strong>1955</strong> - Died in Princeton, aged 77. He wrote a will and told his friends: "I have fulfilled my task on Earth." His last work was an unfinished appeal calling for the prevention of nuclear war. He left behind a legacy as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, whose ideas continue to shape our understanding of the universe today.
